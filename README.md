# Docker image tagged as: <tito274>/news-aggregator:v1

# Deployed on two web servers (Web01 and Web02) with a load balancer (Lb01) configured for round-robin traffic distribution.

# Load balancer ensures high availability and scalability by balancing incoming requests between the two server instances.

# How to Test Load Balancing
# Make repeated requests to the load balancer endpoint (e.g., curl http://localhost).

# Confirm that requests are alternately served from Web01 and Web02.

# Capture logs or screenshots for evidence of load distribution.
